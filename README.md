##  Converting Petri nets to finite state automaton in the GAP computer algebra system 

A small package to generate finite transformation semigroup representation of discrete Petri nets.
Those semigroups then can be decomposed by the SgpDec package (https://github.com/egri-nagy/sgpdec).

the package is used by the BIOMICS (Biological and Mathematical Basis of Interaction Computing) project (http://www.biomicsproject.eu/).
