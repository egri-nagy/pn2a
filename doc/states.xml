There are several ways to specify the set of states (or markings) that will
be used when generating the transformation list. The states used can 
be viewed by accessing the <C>states</C> component of the Petri net record after 
<Ref Func="DumpPetriNet" Label="DumpPetriNet"/> is called.

<Section> 
<Heading>Default Behaviour</Heading>
The Petri net record has a mandatory <C>initial</C> list component which users 
can use to specify an initial set of states. The states that will be considered 
are only those that are reachable from the initial set under some sequence of
transformations.
If the initial list is empty, then all possible states that satisfy the capacity
restrictions will be considered.

</Section>

<Section Label="Additional Conditions"> 
<Heading>Additional Conditions</Heading>
The Petri net record has an optional <C>condition</C> parameter which can be 
used as an additional condition that needs to be satisfied when generating 
the set of states. This parameter must be a boolean function which takes a 
single state (or marking) as input. 
<P/>
Given a non empty set of initial states, all reachable states that satisfy the 
condition will be considered. If the garbage state is enabled with 
<Index>garbage state</Index>
<Ref Func="DumpPetriNet" Label="DumpPetriNet"/>, whenever a transition 
goes to a state that does not satisfy the condition, it will go to the 
garbage state instead. If the garbage state is disabled, the state will be 
allowed even if the condition is not satisfied. In both cases, warning messages
will be printed to standard output.
<P/>
If <C>petrinet.initial</C> is empty, the condition will be used to generate 
all possible states that satisfy the condition and capacity restrictions. 
Reachable states from these states will then be added as above.
